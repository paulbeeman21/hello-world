# hello-world
This is my hello world repository.
I am a first year masters student at UCLA in applied statistics. As an undergraduate student at Western Washington University I studied economics, math, and history. For the past 5 years I have been working as an artist fabricator solving interesting problems using power tools and now I am looking to widen my problem solving abilities through statistical programing. Wish me luck!
